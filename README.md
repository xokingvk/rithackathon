# 🔋 Battery Health Analytics using Machine Learning

An AI-powered Battery Health Analytics web application that predicts **State of Health (SoH)**, **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)**, and detects **battery anomalies** using Machine Learning models trained on the **NASA Lithium-Ion Battery Aging Dataset**.

The project combines a modern web interface with machine learning to help users monitor battery health, estimate battery lifespan, and identify abnormal battery behavior.

---

# 📖 Problem Statement

Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in modern applications such as:

- Electric Vehicles (EVs)
- Energy Storage Systems
- Consumer Electronics
- Robotics
- Industrial Backup Power Systems

As batteries undergo repeated charging and discharging cycles, their performance gradually deteriorates. Battery degradation leads to reduced capacity, shorter operating time, and an increased risk of unexpected failures.

Most Battery Management Systems (BMS) monitor real-time parameters like voltage, current, and temperature, but they often do not provide accurate predictions about battery health or remaining lifetime.

Without reliable battery health estimation:

- Battery failures become unpredictable.
- Maintenance costs increase.
- EV driving range decreases.
- Battery replacement decisions become difficult.
- Safety risks increase due to abnormal battery behavior.

---

# 💡 Solution

This project uses Machine Learning to estimate battery health based on historical battery measurements collected during charging and discharging cycles.

The system predicts:

- 🔋 State of Health (SoH)
- ⏳ Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
- 🚨 Battery Anomaly Detection

The trained models are integrated into a web application that allows users to analyze battery health using either stored battery data or manually entered battery parameters.
